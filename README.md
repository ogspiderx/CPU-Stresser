# 🚀 CPU Stresser 🔥  

**CPU Stresser** is a Python-based stress-testing tool that **pushes your CPU and memory to their limits** by running intensive calculations and memory allocation processes. Use with caution, as it can make your system unresponsive or crash!  

## ⚠️ Disclaimer  
This tool is intended **for testing purposes only**. Running it may cause your system to freeze, overheat, or crash. **Use at your own risk!**  

---

## 🛠 Features  
✔️ Utilizes all available CPU cores for maximum stress.  
✔️ Simulates **heavy memory allocation** to test RAM stability.  
✔️ Simple **confirmation prompt** to prevent accidental execution.  
✔️ Works on **Windows, macOS, and Linux**.

## 📌 Installation  

Make sure you have **Python 3.x** installed.  

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cpu-stresser.git
cd cpu-stresser
pip install -r requirements.txt  # (No dependencies required, but optional for expansion)
```

---

## 🚀 Usage  

Simply run the script:  

```sh
python cpu_stresser.py
```

You will be asked for confirmation before the test begins.  

---

## 🛑 Stopping the Stress Test  
If your system **becomes too slow**, press **Ctrl + C** in the terminal to stop execution.  

On Windows, you may need to **force close Python** from Task Manager (`Ctrl + Shift + Esc`).
